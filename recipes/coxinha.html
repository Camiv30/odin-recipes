            <ol>
                <li>Combine the chicken breasts and 1 cup of chicken broth in a pot over medium heat. Bring to boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through(20 to 30 minutes). Remove chicken from pot, let it cool briefly, and shred it with 2 forks.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook the onions until soft and translucent. Add the shredded chicken, the olives, and the parsley. Stir well and season it with salt and pepper then set it aside.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 cups of chicken broth and the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, season with salt and bring to a simmer. Add flour all at once and stir to form a tick paste. stir vigorously until mixture is smooth and no longer sticks to the bottom of the pan. Set the pastry aside and let it cool.</li>
                <li>Once pastry is cool enough to handle, transfer to an oiled work surface and knead until smooth(2 to 3 minutes).</li>
                <li>Take a portion of pastry and roll into a golf ball-sized ball. Make a small bowl and stuff it with 2 teaspoons of the chicken fillings and gather the top edges to seal, rolling it into a teardrop shape. Set croquette aside and cover it with a damp towel. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.</li>
                <li>Set out 3 bowls in the following order: flour, beaten eggs, and bread crumbs. Roll each croquette in flour, then dip it in the eggs, then cover it in bread crumbs.</li>
                <li>Deep fry the croquettes in a large saucepan at 350 degrees F until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
